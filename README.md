#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Software engeneering was introduced at the 1968 nato software engeneering conference, this event marked the begining of structured methodologies in
  sotware development as there was a software crisis where software projects were often late, overbudget or even unreliable.
2. In the 1970s to 1980s software was written in an unorganised way leading to errors and difficulty in maintaniing, until figures like Edsger Dijkstra promoted the
  use of control structures making code more readable, maintainable and reliable.
3. Agil methodologies emphasised iterative development such as collaboration and flexibility, improving productivity and higher quality software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
>1.Planning
 In this phase, the project’s goals, scope, and requirements are defined. Stakeholders, including clients, users, and project managers, collaborate to understand the specific needs of the software and establish the functional and non-functional requirements. certain topics will be covered like cost and resources.
2.System Design
Based on the requirements gathered in the previous phase, the system architecture and design are created. This phase outlines the structure of the software, including both high-level design and low-level design.
3.Implementation
In this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design documents created in the previous phase. Developers also perform unit testing to ensure the functionality of the code.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
>Waterfall is a traditional, linear, and sequential software development methodology. It follows a clear and predefined set of steps: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase is completed before moving on to the next, and there is little to no overlap between phases, key characteristics include Sequential Process, Rigid Structure, Emphasis on detailed documentation for every phase of the project and  All project requirements are defined upfront, and the timeline, cost, and scope are generally fixed. while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile breaks down the development process into smaller, manageable units (called "sprints"), where each sprint produces a working piece of the software. Agile allows for frequent adjustments based on feedback during the project. key chracteristics include Iterative Process, flexibility, collaboration and feedback. Waterfall is ideal for a project where the client has clear, fixed specifications from the start, such as building a system for a specific regulatory requirement or developing a software tool for a well-defined task (e.g., a payroll system for a small company). Agile is ideal for a startup building a mobile app for a consumer product, where the features may change frequently based on user feedback or market trends. Agile allows for incremental releases, enabling the team to adapt quickly as they receive new information.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the software application. They write the code that brings the software to life and ensure it works as intended. Their work spans the entire software development lifecycle, from understanding requirements to deployment and maintenance.
2. . Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software meets quality standards and works as intended by detecting and fixing defects. They play a crucial role in the testing phase of the software development lifecycle.
3.  Project Manager
 The Project Manager (PM) oversees the entire software development project. They are responsible for planning, executing, and delivering the project on time and within budget. The PM manages the team's workflow, ensures clear communication, and aligns the project with business goals and client needs.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> IDEs provide an all-in-one environment where developers can write, test, and debug code without needing to switch between different tools. This saves time and reduces the likelihood of errors caused by manual tasks, such as compiling and running code outside the environment. IDEs offer features like autocompletion and syntax highlighting, which speed up coding by suggesting possible code completions and visually distinguishing syntax elements (e.g., keywords, variables, functions). This helps developers catch errors early and makes the code easier to read. Examples: vs code, pycharm and xcode
> VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's work. It manages concurrent changes and ensures that changes made by different team members are integrated smoothly. With VCS, every change made to the code is recorded, providing a complete history of the project. This allows developers to revert to previous versions if bugs are introduced or if changes need to be undone. Examples are GIT and Perforce.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
>In many software projects, especially large or long-term ones, requirements can change during the development process. This can be due to shifting business needs, new technologies, or evolving user feedback. These changes can disrupt the development process and lead to delays, rework, or confusion.
Strategy to Overcome:
1.Use Agile practices, such as regular iterations (sprints) and constant feedback loops, as they allow for flexibility. Agile development embraces change, helping teams adjust to new requirements more easily. 2. its good to also maintain open lines of communication with stakeholders, clients, and users to ensure that any changes in requirements are understood and prioritized effectively.
>dealing with technical debt where the shortcuts taken during the development process to meet deadlines, result in code that is not optimal or maintainable in the long term. Over time, technical debt accumulates, making the code harder to maintain, understand, and extend.
Strategy to Overcome:
1.Prioritize Code Quality: Regularly review and refactor code to reduce technical debt. Writing clean, well-structured code from the beginning helps minimize future debt. 2. regular Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure that best practices are followed and potential technical debt issues are caught early.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
>1. Unit Testing
Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or "units" of a software application to ensure they function correctly in isolation. A "unit" is typically the smallest testable part of the application, such as a function or method in the code.
Importance:
Early Detection of Bugs: Unit tests are written during the development process and help catch bugs early by testing each unit before integrating it with the rest of the system.
Improved Code Quality: Unit tests encourage developers to write modular, maintainable code. A unit test for each unit forces developers to focus on smaller pieces of functionality.
>Integration Testing
Integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between multiple components or units of the system. The goal is to ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected when integrated.
Importance:
Identifying Interface Issues: While unit tests verify individual components, integration tests identify issues that arise when those components interact with each other. This could include problems with data passing between modules, API calls, or database interactions.
Validating Data Flow: Integration tests validate the flow of data and functionality between integrated components, ensuring that the system behaves as expected in real-world use cases.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the practice of crafting and refining input queries or prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT. The goal of prompt engineering is to maximize the quality of the model's response by carefully designing the input prompt, ensuring it is clear, concise, and structured in a way that aligns with the desired outcome.
Importance:
>Maximizing Model Performance: The success of interactions with AI models often hinges on how well the prompt is designed. Proper prompt engineering can help ensure that the model generates more accurate, relevant, and useful responses. It can significantly improve the model's performance, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.
>Controlling Output Behavior: By adjusting how a prompt is phrased, prompt engineers can influence the tone, format, style, or level of detail in the model's response. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example:
 "Tell me about the weather" ,a more specific prompt can be "What is the weather forecast for New York City tomorrow?"
 AI models can generate responses to a wide variety of queries, but the quality and relevance of the response often depend on the specificity of the prompt. Prompt engineering helps in avoiding vague or off-target answers.
